# Rogue Reversal #

Rogue Reversal is a RPG that runs backwards. Built for an iPhone, it should work
in most browsers. High scores are sharable and there are over 100 ways to style
your rogue's hair. Have fun.

Made on a Mac for the [js13kGames competition][].

## Features ##

Rogue Reversal has the following bits of awesomeness:

* chunky 16x16 pixel graphics
* over 100 ways to style your rogue's hair
* social bragging rights with tweetable scores

### Technology ###

[Pixen][] was my weapon of choice for all the graphics editing I wound up doing,
and the [Skala Color Picker][] proved a super useful addition to the stock Mac
color picker.

Rogue Reversal uses a pseudo random number generator based on the one described
in the paper, _A New Class of Invertible Mappings_, by Alexander Klimov and Adi
Shamer. I got the math right this time, so there are 16,777,216 possible
starting levels, though only 31,104 of them are unique.

### Graphics ###

I kept a "morgue" folder for inspiration while creating Rogue Reversal. Most of
the work in there comes from [Open Game Art][]. Here are bits that made it into
the final game.

The icons (forward, backward, bow, potion, hand, key, helmet, bottle, and speech
bubble) are monochromatic recolors of the ones from [Jerom's 16x16 fantasy
tileset][jerom]. The Pixen file for those is released under the same [CC-BY-SA
3.0][] license as the originals.

The rogue character is from [Charles Gabriel's 16x18 RPG character hair &amp;
clothing pack][charles]. The Pixen files for that character and her hair styles
are released under the same [CC-BY 3.0][] license as the original.

The bat, chest, rocks, fountain, and stairs come from [Lanea Zimmerman's basic
set of 16x16 tiles][sharm]. The Pixen files for those are released under the
same [CC-BY 3.0][] license as the originals.

The GitHub Octocat and Twitter Bird icons are monochromatic recolors of their
official 16x16 pixel counterparts. The floor tile is my own design and it's
released under the same MIT license as the code.
